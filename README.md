# AtlasVM

This project proposes the development of a distributed virtual machine (VM) capable of executing programs written in a basic programming language (**AtlasPL**). The **AtlasVM** will operate in a distributed system, where multiple nodes collaborate to run a program and reach a consensus on the final output. This project aims to explore the challenges and benefits of distributed computing through a simplified virtual machine framework.
